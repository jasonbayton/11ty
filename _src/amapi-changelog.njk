<p>Time since Google last provided Android Management API release notes:</p>

<h2><span class="blood-orange" id="outputMonths"></span> and <span class="blood-orange" id="outputDays"></span></h2>

<p>This is based on the <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/management/release-notes">AMAPI Release notes</a> page and the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/android-management-api">Android Management API mailing list</a>.</p>

<h3>Why does this matter?</h3>

<p>Google has a monthly cadence for features released to the Android Management API, and fortnightly for Android Device Policy. Without timely and detailed release notes (because "bug fixes" provided on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.work.clouddpc">Google Play</a> don't count) developers have to frequently manually review resources such as the <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/management/reference/rest/v1/enterprises.policies">reference docs</a> for specific changes. Such an important and widely-used service must be held to a high standard for the partners that rely on it.</p>
