## Modern device management can seem overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be.

Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jason, a certified Android SME with a passion for simplifying the complex world of modern device management. For years, I've been a guiding voice in the mobility space, offering my expertise to organisations across the globe through my website here and Social Media ( [<img src="/img/icons/linkedin.svg" class="image-inline-text">](https://linkedin.com/in/jasonbayton) ). My journey began with the first HTC Dream (G1) back in the 2000's, and I've dedicated myself to becoming a recognised authority in modern Android management since it's introduction back in 2014.

I've collaborated with and consulted for leading Android OEMs, Enterprise Mobility vendors, NGOs, multiple fortune listed organisations, and my work has been acknowledged and promoted by industry giants like Google, Sony, Nokia, and many more. Whether you're a small business looking to implement your first mobility strategy or a multinational corporation planning a full-scale device rollout, I've done it all before.

Recognising the growing need for specialised, hands-on support, I've now made the necessary changes to offer sustainable commercial support as an independent contractor over and above what I offer at no cost already. As your mobility partner, I can offer you the necessary knowledge and resources needed to achieve your mobility goals. From strategy planning to end-to-end deployment, I offer a range of services tailored to your specific needs.

So, let's embark on this journey together and make your enterprise mobility vision a reality.

First, who are you? -

## We're an organisation managing devices

I've supported customers with their mobility needs since 2013 across all major OEMs and EMMs. Here are some examples of services I can provide.

### Mobility Strategy

Are you in the early stages of planning for mobile device management in your organisation? Unsure of what to support? _How to start?_ 

We'll look at your objectives and goals. Document your _why_, and ensure we build a strategy that balances investment with guaranteed productivity, security, and user acceptance.

### Device selection & solution validation

I've collaborated with all major Android OEMs and leading EMM vendors in the last several years. Do you want to cut through the marketing and focus on hardware, form factors, and solutions _tailored to your use case?_ I challenge you to find someone who's gone hands-on with more product. With a focus on overall TCO rather than short-term quick wins, we'll ensure your organisation is running the best possible hardware for the best return on investment over the period _you define_. 

### End to end deployment & support

The hard work's done; you know what you want to support and how you're going to do it. The devices are ordered and the licences purchased. Now you've just got to build your policies, configurations, define you application requirements, integrate with your in-house infrastructure and _actually enrol_ the hardware. 

I can help you define your policy requirements, set your security baselines, integrate your chosen vendor into your existing infrastructure, develop documentation and guides, train up internal support staff and power users, and more. Zero-touch? Obviously. eFOTA? Of course. Once we're finished your deployment will be humming away like well-oiled machine.

### What about our iOS, MacOS, ChromeOS, Windows, and Linux devices?

I specialise in the enablement of modern Android management, but I've commercially supported most operating systems on the market. Rest assured no matter what OS you support, if it can be managed, I know how to do so.

### Other activities

Some more examples of dedicated engagements undertaken include:

* EMM migration
* EMM health check
* Mobility strategy planning/review
* EMM & device selection
* EMM deployment, end to end
* Google Workspace deployment
* Android Enterprise hardware validation

## We're a partner or vendor making devices or building solutions

I've been on the vendor side of the ecosystem for the best part of half a decade with a heavy focus on product and support. If you're an organisation building Android devices or services for customers, or reselling products and services, I can help!

### Product validation

Bringing new Android hardware to market? Looking to validate it for enterprise? ~~GMS~~ Play Protect certification will do so much, Android Enterprise Recommended a little more, but if you want true product validation across a range of EMM vendors, talk to me. No other validation in the ecosystem tests Android Enterprise compatibility like I do, with a minimum of a 270-point base report and detailed analysis of required improvements.

If you're an EMM or related solution provider (MTD, insights, etc) looking for help and advice on implementation, feature support, roadmapping & more, I can help there too. I built an EMM used by some of the largest companies in healthcare and food delivery all over the world; I can talk on anything from architecture to roadmap priorities, knowledge base to user experience design and everything in between. I've kicked the tyres and contributed to the development of some of the largest platforms on the market.

### Certification and product development

Building an Android device? I've been there, and I know GMS inside-out. From dedicated, completely bespoke devices for specific use cases, to ensuring consumer devices fare well for enterprise, I can assist in every phase of product development and ensure your Android builds are ready for Google certification. 

If the terms MADA, EDLA, GMS, CTS, Backporting, GRF, and LR/MR/SMR sound familiar to you, I've done it all.

### Other activities

Some more examples of dedicated engagements undertaken include:

* Product consultation on Android Enterprise support for new or existing solutions
* EMM integration & support
* GMS consulting for uncertified (AOSP) devices
* Android Enterprise hardware validation
* Lifecycle & software support strategy
* Product review
