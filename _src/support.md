<h2>Mobility strategy</h2>

Are you in the early stages of planning for mobile device management in your organisation? Unsure of what to support? With experience supporting leading Android OEMs, Fortune-listed organisations, and everything in between, I’ll help you confidently define what success looks like.

We'll look at your objectives and goals. Document your _why_, and ensure we build a strategy that balances investment with guaranteed productivity, security, and user acceptance.

    <h2>Device selection & solution validation</h2>
    
Having collaborated with all major Android OEMs and leading EMM vendors — and with my work acknowledged and promoted by the likes of Google, Sony, Samsung, and HMD/Nokia - I can help cut through the marketing and focus on solutions tailored to your use case.

With a focus on overall TCO rather than short-term quick wins, together we'll ensure your organisation is running the best possible hardware for the best return on investment over the period _you define_.

    <h2>End to end deployment & support</h2>
    
The hard work's done; you know what you want to support and how you're going to do it. The devices are ordered and the licences purchased. Now you've just got to build your policies, configurations, define your application requirements, integrate with your in-house infrastructure and _actually enrol_ the hardware. 

Whether you’re rolling out 10 or 10,000 devices, I can help you define your requirements, set security baselines, train up staff, and deploy with confidence — drawing on experience across global enterprise rollouts and vendor integrations. Once we're finished your deployment will be humming away like well-oiled machine.

    <h2>In-life support</h2>

Keeping your systems in tip-top shape is vital to long-term viability. Whether you need help with EMM migrations, regular health checks, integration with solutions like Google Workspace and IDPs like Okta, or validating your Android Enterprise setup, my in-life support is here to make sure everything runs smoothly. 

Examples: 

* EMM migrations - Let down by your platform? An alternative is not far away.
* EMM health checks - find issues and implement recommendations before things spiral
* Google Workspace deployment - interested in wider adoption of Google's suite of mobility solutions? 
* Android Enterprise hardware validation - Don't buy devices blind; make sure they're up to the task.

    <h2>Complete mobility management</h2>

**Is the thought of managing your fleet of Android and/or ChromeOS devices a bit daunting?**

Offload the day-to-day management of your Google estate with confidence — this service is built on years of enterprise experience across NGOs, carriers, and global businesses, with scalable support for any fleet size. I'll handle onboarding, offboarding, BAU activities, and provide a comfortable SLA for all requests.

Device management is available at **£0.60 per device**, per month, billed annually (**£7.20**), and decreases by commitment duration (12-60 months). This includes the device management licence for Android.

Optional enhanced support is available on request.

    <h2>OEM product validation</h2>

Bringing new Android hardware to market? Looking to validate it for enterprise? ~~GMS~~ Play Protect certification will do so much, Android Enterprise Recommended a little more, but if you want true product validation across a range of EMM vendors, talk to me. No other validation in the ecosystem tests Android Enterprise compatibility like I do, with a minimum of a [270-point base report](https://cdn.bayton.org/uploads/2019/05/Bayton_AE_validation_Pixel3a.1.1.pdf) and detailed analysis of required improvements.

If you're an EMM or related solution provider (MTD, insights, etc) looking for help and advice on implementation, feature support, roadmapping & more, I can help there too. I built an EMM used by some of the largest companies in healthcare and food delivery all over the world; I can talk on anything from architecture to roadmap priorities, knowledge base to user experience design and everything in between. I've kicked the tyres and contributed to the development of some of the largest platforms on the market.

    <h2>Certification and product development</h2>

Building an Android device? I've been there, and I know GMS inside-out. From dedicated, completely bespoke devices for specific use cases, to ensuring consumer devices fare well for enterprise, I can assist in every phase of product development and ensure your Android builds are ready for Google certification. If the terms MADA, EDLA, GMS, CTS, Backporting, GRF, and LR/MR/SMR sound familiar to you, I've done it all.

If you're a software vendor building out a management platform, be that with the Android Management API, Custom DPC, device financing, OEM integration, or various other enterprise use cases, I've built products from bare metal with teams small and large. Get in touch if you'd like to pitch your solution or idea and how I can help.

    <h2>Software development</h2>

I work closely with a network of trusted partners to develop bespoke Android-based application or solutions projects.

An example of projects I've brought to life include:

- [MANAGED SETTINGS](/projects/managed-settings)
- [QR code generator](/qr-generator)
- [PACKAGE SEARCH](/projects/package-search)
- Custom APN management (end-customer)
- OTA device agent (OEM)

With deep experience of the Android Enterprise ecosystem, we can build anything from OEM config applications to EMM platforms, custom DPCs and more. Together, we can bring your Android visions to life.
