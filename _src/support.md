## Modern device management can seem overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be.

I've collaborated with, and/or consulted for, leading Android OEMs, Enterprise Mobility vendors, NGOs, carriers, multiple fortune listed organisations, and my work has been acknowledged and promoted by industry giants including Google, Sony, Nokia (HMD), and many more. Whether you're a small business looking to implement your first mobility strategy or a multinational corporation planning a full-scale device rollout, I've done it all before.

As your mobility partner, I can offer you the necessary knowledge and resources needed to achieve your mobility goals. From strategy planning to end-to-end deployment, I offer a range of services tailored to your specific needs.

So, let's embark on this journey together and make your enterprise mobility vision a reality.

<h3>Mobility strategy</h3>

Are you in the early stages of planning for mobile device management in your organisation? Unsure of what to support? _How to start?_ 

We'll look at your objectives and goals. Document your _why_, and ensure we build a strategy that balances investment with guaranteed productivity, security, and user acceptance.

    <h3>Device selection & solution validation</h3>
    
I've collaborated with all major Android OEMs and leading EMM vendors in the last several years. Do you want to cut through the marketing and focus on hardware, form factors, and solutions _tailored to your use case?_ I challenge you to find someone who's gone hands-on with more product. With a focus on overall TCO rather than short-term quick wins, together we'll ensure your organisation is running the best possible hardware for the best return on investment over the period _you define_.

    <h3>End to end deployment & support</h3>
    
The hard work's done; you know what you want to support and how you're going to do it. The devices are ordered and the licences purchased. Now you've just got to build your policies, configurations, define you application requirements, integrate with your in-house infrastructure and _actually enrol_ the hardware. 

I can help you define your policy requirements, set your security baselines, integrate your chosen vendor into your existing infrastructure, develop documentation and guides, train up internal support staff and power users, and more. Zero-touch? Obviously. eFOTA? Of course. Once we're finished your deployment will be humming away like well-oiled machine.

    <h3>In-life support</h3>

Keeping your systems in tip-top shape is vital to long-term viability. Whether you need help with EMM migrations, regular health checks, integration with solutions like Google Workspace and IDPs like Okta, or validating your Android Enterprise setup, my in-life support is here to make sure everything runs smoothly. 

Examples: 

* EMM migrations - Let down by your platform? An alternative is not far away.
* EMM health checks - find issues and implement recommendations before things spiral
* Google Workspace deployment - interested in wider adoption of Google's suite of mobility solutions? 
* Android Enterprise hardware validation - Don't buy devices blind; make sure they're up to the task.

    <h3>Complete mobility management</h3>

Is the thought of managing your fleet or Android and/or ChromeOS devices giving you a headache?

Offload the day-to-day management of your Google estate in its entirety. I'll handle onboarding, offboarding, BAU activities and provide a comfortable SLA for all requests. 

Device management starts at £0.60 per device, per month, billed annually (£7.20), and decreases by commitment duration (12-60 months). This includes the device management licence for Android. 

Optional enhanced support is available on request.

    <h3>OEM product validation</h3>

Bringing new Android hardware to market? Looking to validate it for enterprise? ~~GMS~~ Play Protect certification will do so much, Android Enterprise Recommended a little more, but if you want true product validation across a range of EMM vendors, talk to me. No other validation in the ecosystem tests Android Enterprise compatibility like I do, with a minimum of a [270-point base report](https://cdn.bayton.org/uploads/2019/05/Bayton_AE_validation_Pixel3a.1.1.pdf) and detailed analysis of required improvements.

If you're an EMM or related solution provider (MTD, insights, etc) looking for help and advice on implementation, feature support, roadmapping & more, I can help there too. I built an EMM used by some of the largest companies in healthcare and food delivery all over the world; I can talk on anything from architecture to roadmap priorities, knowledge base to user experience design and everything in between. I've kicked the tyres and contributed to the development of some of the largest platforms on the market.

    <h3>Certification and product development</h3>

Building an Android device? I've been there, and I know GMS inside-out. From dedicated, completely bespoke devices for specific use cases, to ensuring consumer devices fare well for enterprise, I can assist in every phase of product development and ensure your Android builds are ready for Google certification. If the terms MADA, EDLA, GMS, CTS, Backporting, GRF, and LR/MR/SMR sound familiar to you, I've done it all.

If you're a software vendor building out a management platform, be that with the Android Management API, Custom DPC, device financing, OEM integration, or various other enterprise use cases, I've built products from bare metal with teams small and large. Get in touch if you'd like to pitch your solution or idea and how I can help.
