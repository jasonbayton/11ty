## In summary

**The website offers cookies and site storage** for remembering whether you want a dark or light theme, remembering any details you willingly submit and just generally acting like a website you’ve visited before rather than visiting in incognito every time.

**I do not sell ad space**, nor do I intend to. Your data is therefore not being mined to line my pockets.

**I do collect analytics data**, mostly to keep tabs on how the site is performing – post views, countries that visit, browser and OS details, and so on. Where offered however **I anonymise identifiable info** such as full IP ranges. Current analytics platforms are Google, Posthog and Cloudflare.

If you want your info deleted, just ask.

## In detail

### Who I am

The website address is: https://bayton.org. General information about me and the blog can be found on [About](/about/).

### What personal data is collected and why

#### Contact forms

Any information you submit on any contact form is collected and emailed to me.

#### Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

#### Analytics

Currently the site uses 3 analytics platforms, two of which are controlled by third parties:

- Google analytics
- Posthog
- Cloudflare analytics

### Who your data is shared with

Any data collected is not sold or passed on to any 3rd party for commercial reasons.

Furthermore, the site doesn’t sell advertising so there are no concerns.

### How long your data is retained

Indefinitely in the case of form data, as I don't delete emails. 

### Where your data is sent

See analytics services listed above.
