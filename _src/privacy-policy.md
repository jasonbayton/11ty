In summary
----------

**The website offers cookies and site storage** for remembering whether you want a dark or light theme, remembering any details you willingly submit and just generally acting like a website you’ve visited before rather than visiting in incognito every time.

**I do not sell ad space**, nor do I intend to. Your data is therefore not being mined to line my pockets.

**I do collect analytics data**, mostly to keep tabs on how the site is performing – post views, countries that visit, browser and OS details, and so on. Where offered however **I anonymise identifiable info** such as full IP ranges. Current analytics platforms are Google, JetPack and my own self-hosted Matomo.

If you want your info deleted, just ask.

In detail
---------

Who I am
--------

The website address is: https://bayton.org. General information about me and the blog can be found on [About](https://bayton.org/about/).

What personal data is collected and why
---------------------------------------

### Comments

When leaving comments on the site or via [Discuss](https://discuss.bayton.org), data collected includes:

- the data shown in the comments form
- the visitor’s IP address
- browser user agent string
- email address
- given name
- if using SSO, the existence of such an account (but no details from it)

This is to help spam detection and in order for the content to be adequately displayed on the website in a way it can be engaged with and notifications of replies can be sent.

An anonymized string created from a submitted email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After submitting a your comment, the linked profile picture, a given name and user ID is visible to the public in the context of the comment.

### Media

If uploading images to the website, please avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

### Contact forms

Any information you submit on any contact form is collected and emailed to me.

### Cookies

If leaving a comment on the site it’s possible to opt-in to saving the submitted name, email address and website in cookies. These are for convenience so that they do not have to be filled in again when leaving another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

By creating an account here or on Discuss and logging in, a temporary cookie to determine if the visiting browser accepts cookies will be set. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you closing the browser.

When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.

### Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

### Analytics

Currently the site uses 3 analytics platforms, two of which are controlled by third parties:

- Google analytics
- JetPack by WordPress
- Matomo (self-hosted)

Who your data is shared with
----------------------------

Any data collected is not sold or passed on to any 3rd party for commercial reasons.

Furthermore, the site doesn’t sell advertising so there are no concerns.

How long your data is retained
------------------------------

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely on a self-hosted server under full control of the site owner.

For users that register on the website or Discuss, the personal information provided in their user profile will be stored. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time. Administrators can also see and edit that information.

What rights you have over your data
-----------------------------------

If you have an account on this site or Discuss, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data held about you, including any data you have provided. You can also request that any personal data held about you is erased or anonymised.
