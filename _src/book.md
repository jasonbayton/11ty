**Daddy's Phone Can't Do That!** takes the young mind through a journey of discovery of why a corporate phone can't do some of the things personal phones do by default, and explores the topic of Mobile Device Management through the responsibilities of Andy Admin, the IT wizard, and Big Boss Bill, the C-level who _just wants to keep his corporate secrets safe_.

### What they're saying

**"Enterprise Mobility for Minors. You are a visionary."**

**"I think it is great to raise awareness to this as well as ensuring there is a healthy mix work and personal and ensuring a split between “tech” and “non-tech” in our lives."**  
_- Ajay Patel, Technical Account Manager, B2B_

**"Oh wow, simply brilliant!"**  
_- RP Gill, Product Engineering lead_

**"It's important to be safe and play outside a lot"**
_- Mika, age 8_
