Today's the day! 

Android 14 is officially released ðŸŽ‰

Dev: ðŸ”— [https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/10/android-14-is-live-in-aosp.html](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/10/android-14-is-live-in-aosp.html)

I don't know about yourselves, but the 14 cycle felt much longer than previous versions. There was a delay, sure, but even so. In any case, 14 is rolling out to Pixels as we speak, with the wider ecosystem in line with their own schedules ðŸš€

Need a reminder of what's new in 14 for enterprise? Say less: ðŸ”— [https://bayton.org/blog/2023/04/android-enterprise-in-android-14/](https://bayton.org/blog/2023/04/android-enterprise-in-android-14/)
