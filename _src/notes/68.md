Another day, another Android 14* feature shoutout!

Are you taking advantage of quick-switching between work and personal versions of installed apps? 

Obviously until wider adoption the target audience is somewhat limited to organisations that predominantly lean on Google applications, but those who can.. should!

I leveraged this frequently up to moving on late last year, it's a nice little timesaver - I whipped back and forth between work and personal calendars constantly, closely followed by Authenticator 🔁

*Technically around QPR3 in 13, but it wasn't official 👀
