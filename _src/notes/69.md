We're throwing it back to the basics today. 

Managing private applications and web applications via the Google Play iFrame, docs first published in 2018 that just received a 2024 update. 

Would you believe in 5 years the asterisk against the Name field in WS1UEM hasn't been removed, despite not being required? I wonder how many customers that's caught out 😁

🔗 Web apps [https://bayton.org/android/create-and-manage-web-apps-for-android-enterprise/](https://bayton.org/android/create-and-manage-web-apps-for-android-enterprise/)

I'm well-overdue a doc that covers all application distribution methods across PlayEMM API, AOSP, and AMAPI. That'll come in due course too!
