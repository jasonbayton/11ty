Happy Friday folks ðŸ˜Š

Just in time for the weekend, Google are currently investigating an issue with applications not showing in the managed Google Play Store on devices.

Customer community ðŸ”— [https://www.androidenterprise.community/t5/general-discussions/service-announcement-available-work-apps-missing-in-managed/td-p/811](https://www.androidenterprise.community/t5/general-discussions/service-announcement-available-work-apps-missing-in-managed/td-p/811)

There's an open request in the above link for any customers experiencing the same to reach out; I don't believe it has been widely reported just yet.

If you have the opportunity, please grab a managed device with applications deployed and take a quick look in Play. If any or all of the deployed apps are missing (even if they install on-device without problems), please sound off in the community!
