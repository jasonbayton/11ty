AMAPI release notes are up for November ðŸ˜Š

ðŸ”— [https://developers.google.com/android/management/release-notes](https://developers.google.com/android/management/release-notes)

We get some additional networking capabilities for Android 12+, and a change to how local device events are reported.

Thank you as ever to the Googlers keeping this going consistently over the past few months. Please resume adding ADP changelogs here also!
