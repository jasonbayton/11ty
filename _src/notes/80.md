Continuing the theme of communities, did you know Google has an official Android Enterprise community?

Run by community managers Lizzie & Reece, along with several dedicated community folks including myself, Jeremy, Rafael and a few others, the AE Community is a great place not only to have your pressing AE questions answered, but also increasingly to track - publicly - service announcements that were previously hidden away within partner portals.

As the community grows this year, we're aiming to fill it with more resources, videos, guides, and much more. It's a great place to be both as a customer leveraging AE, and a partner for keeping tabs on the goings-on in a public forum. 

If you're so inclined, we'd love some additional experts to help out, too :)
