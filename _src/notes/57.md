AMAPI release notes are up! 

ðŸ”— [https://developers.google.com/android/management/release-notes](https://developers.google.com/android/management/release-notes)

A quiet month it seems, just the one new feature to mention. 

But it's a good one ðŸ‘€

Apps launched with SetupAction (with AMAPI, this would often be a Companion app) are now able to cancel enrolment. Device doesn't meet a particular criterion? Authentication issues? Fancy a big fat button that says "Cancel!"? Now you can cancel from the app and avoid the faff ðŸ˜Ž
