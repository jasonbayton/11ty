It looks like Samsung has added yet another device to their lineup benefitting from 4 major OS updates and 5 years of security.. and it's the one of the most budget-friendly offerings available with that longevity!

The [Galaxy A24](https://www.samsung.com/africa_en/smartphones/galaxy-a/galaxy-a24-black-128gb-sm-a245fzkvafc/) comes in at under $300/£240 (converted) and is pretty well-specced for the price. Regional availability is limited but honestly that makes it even more impressive to me; seeing commitment to a 5 year lifecycle for a device that isn't globally available - it's the same amount of effort to support this after all whether you sell a hundred or a million.

I am absolutely here for the consumer market setting the bar higher for security and longevity. Long may this trend continue!
