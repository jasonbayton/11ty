In case you missed it yesterday, AMAPI announced day-zero support for several new Android 14 features:

Expect these to show up pretty soon in AMAPI-based EMMs, vendor roadmaps permitting 😁

In related news, the AE team have popped together a handy FAQ for features just released:

Who's seeing 14 show up in their estates already? 🙋‍♂️ Conversely, who's popped in a freeze period to avoid it landing just yet? 👀
