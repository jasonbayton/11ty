I switched on a dormant Pixel this evening - off for a good 5 months - and the work profile let me know it needed to removed. 

I don't remember triggering a wipe of the work profile from where it was enrolled, but in 5 months who knows what could have happened.

Anyway, going to set up the WP again and I get the dreaded "A work profile can't be added to this device."

Quick and easy debugging for that? Pop adb debugging on, and follow the guide here - [https://bayton.org/android/android-enterprise-faq/enrolment-failed-delete-wp/](https://bayton.org/android/android-enterprise-faq/enrolment-failed-delete-wp/)

Less than 3 mins and I'm back enrolling again. The process to wipe the WP didn't remove the WP user for some reason, so that was a very easy fix.
