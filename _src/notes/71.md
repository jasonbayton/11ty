Does anyone remember the Astro Slide from Planet Computers?

I contributed to their Indiegogo campaign waaay back in Sep 2022 with the hopes of getting hands on with what would be the first clamshell Android device I've used. 

Well here we are, years later, with them not responding to requests for updates after promising deliveries over and over. 

Even if it did ship today, running a 5yo SOC with a years-old version of Android wouldn't inspire long-term confidence now. 

Alas, I really wanted to support a home-grown company pushing back on the typical slab of glass.
