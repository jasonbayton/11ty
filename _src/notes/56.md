After more than 4 years with Social Mobile, diving deep into the waters of Android manufacturing, EMM development, and getting the opportunity to be the closest I've ever been to the "other side" of the Android ecosystem, today I'm moving on.

It's been a rollercoaster; from the ad-hoc meeting with Rob at MWC that led to a there-and-then invite to join Social Mobile, starting out with just a handful of people in the earliest days of the company's transition from consumer OEM to being the Enterprise-first services organisation it is today, I will fondly remember jumping pillar to post, touching everything from product development to enterprise strategy to IT process improvement, QA, and so many other facets of the business for which there are now dedicated teams taking care of countless customers and projects.

I'm happy leaving knowing I've made lasting contributions to the organisation, and wish them all the very best in their future endeavours. 

Stay tuned for what's next ðŸ™‚
