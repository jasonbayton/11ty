Happy Sunday folks!

Are you a WS1 UEM admin still managing Android devices via the legacy, deprecated, and wholly unrecommended Device Admin approach?

If you're wondering "where do I even begin with this?!", fret not! I've updated my Considerations when migration from device admin to Android Enterprise doc for late-2023, so you might consider taking a gander 🧐 and making some notes 📝:
