After weeks of speculation, Samsung have dropped a KB outlining the issue with zero-touch on their Android 14 builds.

ðŸ”— [https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-platform-for-enterprise/kbas/kba-1120-unable-to-enroll-device-with-zero-touch-enrollment/](https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-platform-for-enterprise/kbas/kba-1120-unable-to-enroll-device-with-zero-touch-enrollment/)

In a nutshell a preloaded version of GmsCore (v23.34.14) is the culprit, and unfortunately has found itself present in the builds of several models running Android 14. 

As expected, resolution will indeed be via OTA and ZT functionality will be restored when this becomes available for affected models. The ETA for this hasn't been published, unfortunately ðŸ™„.
