Looks like the AMAPI folks have been busy!

Last week, Google again updated their permissible usage policy for AMAPI with new restrictions on non-validated projects.

Going forward, and as-confirmed with AMAPI API changes earlier today, the use of FRP and factory reset policies will no longer be possible for Google Cloud Projects that have not been validated with the Android Enterprise team. Validation happens after onboarding into the Android Enterprise Partner Portal. - [https://www.androidenterprise.dev](https://www.androidenterprise.dev).

In other news, the preferential network service, the policy that configured 5G slicing in the work profile, appears to be expanding to fully managed devices, and has gained a per-app setting - "preferentialNetworkId". Docs: [https://developers.google.com/android/management/reference/rest/v1/enterprises.policies#preferentialnetworkservice](https://developers.google.com/android/management/reference/rest/v1/enterprises.policies#preferentialnetworkservice). 

Continuing with network settings, Google has finally(!!!!!!!) added APN configuration settings to AMAPI ðŸ¤© - [https://developers.google.com/android/management/reference/rest/v1/enterprises.policies#apnpolicy](https://developers.google.com/android/management/reference/rest/v1/enterprises.policies#apnpolicy)

And as I write this.. the release notes have appeared covering off changes in April - [https://developers.google.com/android/management/release-notes](https://developers.google.com/android/management/release-notes)

Lots of movement ahead of the partner summit in a couple of weeks!
