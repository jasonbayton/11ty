Chromebooks are getting 10 years of updates ðŸŽ‰

"Starting in 2024, if you have Chromebooks that were released from 2021 onwards, youâ€™ll automatically get 10 years of updates. For Chromebooks released before 2021 and already in use, users and IT admins will have the option to extend automatic updates to 10 years from the platformâ€™s release (after they receive their last automatic update)."

Applying both to modern, and older* devices, this is fantastic news considering their prevalence in budget-constrained markets where they're already chosen for their lower cost. TCO drops even further when devices are supported longer.

*On pre-2021 devices Google doesn't commit to supporting all features and functionality.
