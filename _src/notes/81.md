It's been a while since I last ran a poll, so here we go - a precursor to a much larger survey I'll be releasing later this week.

Unfortunately LinkedIn polls are a little basic, so I hope you won't mind popping over to Google forms for me :)

I'll publish the results of this in the next several days, hopefully with a sizeable response to garner a decent sample (please!)
