With the Play Integrity API stepping in for SafetyNet [link](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/safetynet/deprecation-timeline) and AMAPI having already supported it for some time (though exactly when isn't provided by the [release notes](https://developers.google.com/android/management/release-notes)), I submitted a request to have the AMAPI docs updated as they were still referencing SafetyNet, and got confirmation over the weekend this has now been completed.

If you were at all thrown off by continued references to SafetyNet recently, now it's ready to go ðŸ˜Ž

[https://developers.google.com/android/management/reference/rest/v1/enterprises.devices#securityrisk]()

As an additional tidbit, if you're curious: AMAPI makes a STANDARD API request, not classic. [ref](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/standard).
