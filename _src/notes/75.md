I noticed a LinkedIn contributor article this morning referencing AV for mobile devices, and left a comment - [https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/youre-always-go-how-can-you-make-your-mobile-device-lyboe?contributionUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28articleSegment%3A%28urn%3Ali%3AlinkedInArticle%3A7141179861884137472%2C7141179863683461122%29%2C7151161297114472448%29](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/youre-always-go-how-can-you-make-your-mobile-device-lyboe?contributionUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28articleSegment%3A%28urn%3Ali%3AlinkedInArticle%3A7141179861884137472%2C7141179863683461122%29%2C7151161297114472448%29)

It reminded me of a MTD Android Enterprise consideration doc I wrote a few years ago:

[https://bayton.org/android/mtd-and-android-enterprise/](https://bayton.org/android/mtd-and-android-enterprise/)

It's been a good few years since I did my own MTD deployments, though I tinkered a fair bit with Wandera before they were bought up more recently. I should probably see if my old Lookout accounts still work and get myself refreshed on the topic :)
