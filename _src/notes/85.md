It's been a busy day! We have:

AMAPI release notes: [https://developers.google.com/android/management/release-notes#jan-2024](https://developers.google.com/android/management/release-notes#jan-2024)

An update on AMAPI DPC migration: [https://bayton.org/blog/2024/01/amapi-migrations/#update](https://bayton.org/blog/2024/01/amapi-migrations/#update)

An update to TestDPC: [https://github.com/googlesamples/android-testdpc/releases/tag/v9.0.3](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-testdpc/releases/tag/v9.0.3) (with release notes, AMAPI ADP devs take note)
