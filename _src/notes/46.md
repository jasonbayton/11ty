Happy Monday! 

Last week Intune suffered a bug that saw the security patch level (SPL) of BYO (Work Profile) Android devices disappear.

Reported by Jarmo via the Android Customer Community, MS appear to have now fixed it.

Just in case anyone noticed, but didn't opt to take action :)

If you're not perusing the customer community just yet, this is a really nice use case for it and I'd encourage more customers (and partners) to hang out there.
