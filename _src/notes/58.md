The Galaxy Fold 5G, the original from 2019, has been removed from Samsung's list of supported models for monthly security updates. 

At a smidge over 4 years of security updates, that's not bad for the year it was released.

Like other models, I'm sure original Fold owners may see the occasional critical update, but now's a good time to start looking for a newer, supported model.
