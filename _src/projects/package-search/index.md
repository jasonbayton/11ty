**PACKAGE SEARCH is an enterprise-biased Android application inspection utility designed to provide detailed information about the apps installed on managed Android devices.**

## What does PACKAGE SEARCH do?

PACKAGE SEARCH offers organisations and private individuals alike a simple, efficient way of viewing <span id="dynamic_word">installed applications</span>.

A core USP (unique selling point) of PACKAGE SEARCH is the ability to view applications _not available for the current user_. In other words, applications disabled predominantly by the Android Enterprise managed provisioning flow. This applies both for company-owned fully managed devices, as well as offering visibility into system applications not enabled within a personally owned work profile deployment, allowing organisations to deploy PACKAGE SEARCH under any deployment scenario knowing all applications - enabled, disabled, and unavailable, will be present within the app.

## Who is PACKAGE SEARCH for?

- Do you struggle with missing core applications after EMM enrolment on managed Android devices?
- Does the need to set up an unmanaged device to gain access to typical system applications through most package viewers on the market frustrate you?

The primary use case for PACKAGE SEARCH is to locate the names and package names of unavailable applications on managed devices. That said, based on known friction points, the following additional features are incorporated:

- View the version name and version code of all installed, available applications.
- Track applications with too-low target API versions
- See when applications were last updated
- Full text search, as well as filters (see below)
- View assigned managed configurations to an application

.. and more! PACKAGE SEARCH is a quickly-evolving application.

Due to the nature of the application, PACKAGE SEARCH can be useful for consumers and private individuals alike also. Feedback is critically important to me, so I do encourage use and honest feedback.

## What does PACKAGE SEARCH cost?

PACKAGE SEARCH is a **free** application. If you'd like to contribute to continued development of new and existing projects, either as an individual or corporate sponsor, please do [get in touch](/contact)!
