**Features & improvements**

- Added app uninstall for user apps. You'll notice a small red bin (trash can) on the bottom-right of user application cards from this release. It allows quick and easy app uninstallation directly from PACKAGE SEARCH.
- From 1030 the versioning increments are changing, with the minor version moving a step to the left, allowing for patch versions in the last number column. Patches will in future also increment beyond x.x.x.9 and into double digits until it makes sense to bump to a new minor version.

**Fixes**

- Fixed keyboard blocking app cards when open. Now the virtual keyboard is factored into the scroll area, and apps scroll correctly to the bottom of the list.

**Known issues**
