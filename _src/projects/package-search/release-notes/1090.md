**Features & improvements**

- Added a manual poll button (refresh) for managed configs, removing the need to tap out and back into an app card to see updates
- Improved PING resilience for the system apps database sync. In instances where the Android version updates and changes the preloaded packages, this was overwriting a device record. This will no longer happen.
