**Features & improvements**

- Package search can now sync system apps to the [system apps database](/android/android-system-app-database/) and help build the most complete system app library available.
- Added the first managed configuration to enable system app sync remotely. Admins struggling to locate system apps required for system features can enable the config, wait several minutes, and find the system apps of that device in the [system apps database](/android/android-system-app-database/)
- Added a link to release notes in app settings
- Improved version sync (beta) logic & reliability
- Added translations
