**Features & improvements**

- Refactored the search UX. I know it's been less-than-perfect on smaller devices given the size and stickiness of it. Now search lives behind a much less obnoxious button, and slides in and out as required. Please send me feedback in-app with your thoughts! 
- Removed and optimised some unused/unnecessary functions.

**Fixes**

- Resolved an issue with modals closing on device rotation.

**Known issues**
