**Features & improvements**

- Understanding the options to sync applications to a remote server may not be in the best interests of organisations, guards have been added to give admins control of these features.
  1. A managed config has been provided for version tracking, in addition to system app sync in 1.0.6.8. 
  2. Whenever PACKAGE SEARCH detects _any_ managed config, it will disable the toggles in Settings for both options, mandating this is set via policy only, and cannot be overridden.

If user-override is desired, simply clear the managed config. Platforms like Intune support this by unchecking the respective configurations no longer desired, other platforms allow unsetting a config within the options of the configuration itself. If this is a friction point, please [let me know](/contact).

**Fixes**

- Minor improvement to worker behaviour
