**Features & improvements**

- Added a card for applications identified as DPC-like. This new card will provide the registered Device Admin Receivers as well as the Admin Signature Checksum, two fields required for creating a provisioning QR code for a custom DPC. Feel free to test it out with my [QR generator](/qr-generator).
