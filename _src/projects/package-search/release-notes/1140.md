**Features & improvements**

- Added support for on-device system application enablement where:
  - The device has been provisioned fully managed
  - System applications were not previously enabled
  - System applications have not been altered by any other means (EMM policy, etc)

With this feature, it is possible to delegate the work of enabling a system app directly to a user of a device. This may speed up troubleshooting for missing system apps.

_Keep in mind, once a system app is enabled, it cannot be disabled through PACKAGE SEARCH. This would be done through EMM policy._
