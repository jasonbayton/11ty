**Known issues**

Some OEMs/devices do not support AOSP settings intents.

Where alternative intents exist, support will be added. If you're testing with devices that do not open intents, you can submit information to aid in resolution through the following process:
1. Open your native Android Settings application
2. Tap in to the Setting (e.g., Wi-Fi) that doesn't launch through MANAGED SETTINGS. Do this several times.
3. Note the time to the second (13:31:45) when doing this, [then capture a bug report](/android/how-to-capture-device-logs/).
4. Upload the bug report to the [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYQrOPM0dKwCmcSjfxgoK2rQvhQXXyw2pk9nMqYBn0F2IhRw/viewform?usp=sf_link), inputting the operating system version (14), OEM (Samsung) and Model (Galaxy S24) within the text input.

OEM/device support is tracked via [this document](/projects/managed-settings/oem-support/).
