## New features

This is the initial release, so all features are documented on the [project homepage](../../).

## Fixes

N/A

## Known issues

**Some OEMs/devices do not support AOSP settings intents.**

Where alternative intents exist, support will be added. If you're testing with devices that do not open intents, you can submit information to aid in resolution through the following process:
1. Open your native Android Settings application
2. Tap in to the Setting (e.g., Wi-Fi) that doesn't launch through MANAGED SETTINGS. Do this several times.
3. Note the time to the second (13:31:45) when doing this, [then capture a bug report](/android/how-to-capture-device-logs/).
4. Upload the bug report to the [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYQrOPM0dKwCmcSjfxgoK2rQvhQXXyw2pk9nMqYBn0F2IhRw/viewform?usp=sf_link), inputting the operating system version (14), OEM (Samsung) and Model (Galaxy S24) within the text input.

OEM/device support will be tracked via [this document](/projects/managed-settings/oem-support/) once internal testing is complete.
