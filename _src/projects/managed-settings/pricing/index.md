*For organisations or EDU with budget constraints, please get in touch.*

## Charities & NPOs

These applications are licensable at no charge for charities and non-profits, including help & guidance to get set up. Please get in touch to validate your status and a licence will be generated.

## For resellers & vendors

If you're an ecosystem partner (or organisation) there are two current approaches:

**Resell**: Licence customers on the standard package (as above). Get in touch to discuss reseller discounts.

**Whitelabel**: Licence a version that is customised out of box (no waiting for managed configs to apply). £3,000 will grant you a vendor licence to distribute across your customer base, and a flat one-time £300 for each organisation ID associated with your custom package ID, or £0.30 per device.

<div class="responsive-table-wrapper">

| Licence             | Devices    | Cost   | 
| ------------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| **Customised app**  | ∞          | £3,000 | 
| **Organisation ID** | ∞          | £300   |  
|                     | Per device | £0.30  |

## <span class="material-symbols-outlined orange">support</span> Priority support

MANAGED SETTINGS comes with access to email support, access to the Discord community, and documentation. If you'd like additional support, priority offers:

- A dedicated, private communication channel (Discord & voice)
- Faster (UK hours) responses
- Precedence on feature requests 
- Deployment and configuration assistance
- Discounted consultancy (hours)

**It's an annual recurring fee**.

Invoicing is available if Stripe isn't your thing. If your organisation leverages multiple organisation IDs as one company, licence your primary ID. If each ID is an individual organisation please licence accordingly. I won't know either way, but the earnings go towards funding continued projects and free support in the ecosystem, so dodging fair licensing sucks for everyone.

<div class="callout-heading callout-heading-small callout-icon-sad">I don't like this pricing</div>

Hey, that's OK, reach out to me. 

The pricing reflects my local market and what I think is fair for the effort put in to building and supporting this utility, it's not intended to dissuade use. 

Get in touch to discuss, and we can come to an agreement.
