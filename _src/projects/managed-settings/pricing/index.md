## For organisations 

Customisation is available per organisation ID, and licensed accordingly:

<div class="responsive-table-wrapper">

| Licence | Devices        | Cost   |          | 
| ------- | -------------- | ------ | -------- |
| **Organisation ID**  | 0 - 2,000      | £500   | <span class="material-symbols-outlined">shopping_bag</span> [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/aEUeVS0tOcqo4GA9AC) |
|         | 2,001 - 5,000  | £700   | <span class="material-symbols-outlined">shopping_bag</span> [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/6oEdROgsM0HG0qk4gj) |
|         | 5,001 - ∞      | £1,000 | <span class="material-symbols-outlined">shopping_bag</span> [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/9AQ2966Scdus8WQbIM) |
| **Priority support** | ∞     | £1,000p.a | <span class="material-symbols-outlined">shopping_bag</span> [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/eVa4he3G01LK6OI28d) | 

</div>

*For organisations, EDU, or charities with budget constraints, please get in touch.*

#### <span class="material-symbols-outlined orange">support</span> Priority support

MANAGED SETTINGS comes with access to email support, access to the Discord community, and documentation. If you'd like additional support, priority offers:

- A dedicated, private communication channel (Discord & voice)
- Faster (UK hours) responses
- Precedence on feature requests 
- Deployment and configuration assistance

**It's an annual recurring fee**.

Invoicing is available if Stripe isn't your thing. If your organisation leverages multiple organisation IDs as one company, licence your primary ID. If each ID is an individual organisation please licence accordingly. I won't know either way, but the earnings go towards funding continued projects and free support in the ecosystem, so dodging fair licensing sucks for everyone. 

## For vendors

If you're an ecosystem partner (or organisation) wishing to licence a version that is customised out of box (no waiting for managed configs to apply), £3,000 will grant you a vendor licence to distribute across your customer base, and a flat £300 for each organisation ID associated with your custom package ID.

<div class="responsive-table-wrapper">

| Licence | Devices | Cost | 
| ------- | ------- | ---- |
| **Customised app** | ∞ | £3,000 | 
| **Organisation ID** | ∞ | £300 |  

</div>

Of course you may choose to licence customers on the standard package as organisations above, get in touch to discuss reseller discounts.

Hey, that's OK. The pricing reflects my local market and what I think is fair for the effort put in to building and supporting this utility, it's not intended to dissuade use. 

Get in touch to discuss, and we can come to an agreement.
