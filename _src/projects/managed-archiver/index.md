**MANAGED ARCHIVER is a utility for backing up Android messages, including SMS, MMS, and RCS. In combination with Google Messages as the default messaging application, Archiver will immediately capture, and sync, every message a device sends or receives as it happens**

## What does Archiver do?

Archiver enables administrators to:

- Sync SMS, MMS, and RCS messages to the PING cloud infrastructure
- Sync files and attachments associated with each message ID 
- Use a simple, secure API interface to fetch message and attachment data for integration with internal systems.

_Note: For direct sync to a custom API endpoint, please [reach out](/contact)_.

## What does Archiver solve?

- **Message retention**: Ensure any and all device messages are captured and accessible for the period of time required by your organisation
- **Accountability and transparency**: Immediately pull up message logs where circumstances mandate it
- **Compliance and auditing**: Guarantee messages sent or received on company property are backed up and auditable

Whether you need a simple backup solution, or have strict requirements to adhere to, Archiver offers a safe, reliable, and instant capture solution for device messaging.

## What does Archiver cost?

Archiver starts from as little as £0.10 per device, per month. Custom endpoint support and additional development requirements may increase this.

For fully whitelabeled options, costs remain in-line with other projects, £3000.

## Get started

Archiver is not publicly available at this time. Instead, it is provided as a private application shared directly to the organisation ID of a customer's managed Android Enterprise bind and can be fetched via managed Google Play. The process is simple (and handled entirely server-side, no customer effort is required). A version may be publicly released in Google Play at a later date, and will be fully interoperable with any existing versions deployed.

Please [get in touch](/contact) to discuss requirements and deployment strategy.
