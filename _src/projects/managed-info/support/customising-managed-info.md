To set customisation options, your organisation must be licensed. If you do not have a valid licence, please contact [project-support@bayton.org](mailto:project-support@bayton.org) to obtain one. Pricing is defined on the [project page](/projects/managed-settings/#what-does-managed-settings-cost).

## Available customisations

MANAGED INFO offers the following customisations:

**Disable settings** _- 1.0.0.2_
: The option to disable access to MANAGED INFO settings, where BAYTON branding, links, and resources are provided. This will also adjust the left-hand application icon to lessen the SWIRL branding.

**App title** _- 1.0.0.1_
: The option to replace the default app title of **Info** with another.

**Disable fun** _- 1.0.0.3_
: Removes the Baydroid mascot and swaps with a generic icon for warning states.

**Custom card** _-1.0.0.2_
: Allows for a custom card with a custom title to be configured. It'll show underneath the organisation message when all items are enabled.

### In future

If you'd like to see more customisation options, or general features, [raise a feature request](https://github.com/baytonorg/managed_info_tracker/issues/) or discuss your requirements on the [MANAGED INFO Discord channel](https://discord.gg/7VzRZWVkht).

## Enter your organisation ID

In order to unlock customisations, input the licensed organisation ID of Android Enterprise bind. You can find this in two ways:

- Head to [Google Play admin settings](https://play.google.com/work/adminsettings) and log in with the account you used for your bind
- Open the managed Google Play iFrame within your EMM, and click the settings icon in the top right of the iFrame

If you've set up your organisation with the new customer signup (BTE) flow, you may also locate your Android Enterprise bind organisation ID through [Third-party Integrations](https://admin.google.com/ac/devices/settings/thirdparty) in the Google Workspace/Cloud identity admin console.

## Customise available settings

With a valid organisation ID set, you may continue to configure all customisation options in addition to the standard, unlicensed & freely available settings intents.
