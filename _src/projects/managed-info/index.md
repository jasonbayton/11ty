**MANAGED INFO is an information, or support, utility designed to provide managed Android device users with a simple interface configured with actions, support information, and device details.**

## What does MANAGED INFO do?

MANAGED INFO allows an administrator to configure:

- Quick actions, for calling, emailing, browsing a website, or pulling up a configured location
- Organisation messages, with basic HTML support, allowing for rich, admin-defined messaging in-app
- Contact information
- Device details

## Who is MANAGED INFO for?

Useful in a multi-app kiosk environment as a means of providing help & support information, but equally offers typical knowledge worker deployment scenarios direct access to organisation-defined information at the tap of an icon.

## What does MANAGED INFO cost?

MANAGED INFO is a **free** application. An optional licence unlocks additional customisation options, including:

- Hiding branding
- Custom app title
- Custom information cards
- Disabling fun (üòÅ)

If desired, MANAGED INFO can be organisation-branded as a custom application. Please do get in touch if interested.
