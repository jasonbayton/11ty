**MANAGED INFO is a powerful information and support utility for Android Enterprise deployments, offering a flexible interface for delivering actions, support content, and contextual device details - now with hybrid kiosk and launcher functionality.**

## What does MANAGED INFO do?

MANAGED INFO enables administrators to configure:

- **Quick actions**: Call, email, browse a website, or open a map location at a tap
- **Organisation messages**: Show rich messages using HTML for onboarding, compliance, or guidance
- **Contact information**: Display relevant IT or business support details
- **Device details**: Surface technical and diagnostic info from the device itself
- **Custom layouts**: Build fully bespoke experiences with stack-based layouts, app cards, banners, section titles, and more
- **Launcher mode**: Transform MANAGED INFO into a custom home screen, replacing the Android launcher
- **Admin override**: Secure local access to full device capabilities via PIN, bypassing kiosk constraints temporarily

## Who is MANAGED INFO for?

- **Kiosk deployments**: Deliver support, compliance, and access to key apps in retail, healthcare, or logistics environments
- **Knowledge worker devices**: Offer rich, branded help content and device info to staff
- **Custom deployments**: Build role-based or team-specific layouts using branded templates, colours, and app sets

Whether you're running a multi-app kiosk environment or offering a branded launcher experience, MANAGED INFO adapts to your environment - fully configurable via any supported EMM.

## What does MANAGED INFO cost?

MANAGED INFO is a **free** application. An optional licence unlocks additional integration options, including:

- **Device metadata sync off-device**
- **Integrate device trust signals into your product/solution**
- **Integrate location tracking into your product/solution**

Licensing can be per device, or a flat fee per organisation. Branding and white-label builds are also available.
