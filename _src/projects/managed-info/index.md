**MANAGED INFO is a powerful information and support utility for Android Enterprise deployments, offering a flexible interface for delivering actions, support content, and contextual device details ‚Äî now with hybrid kiosk and launcher functionality.**

- **Organisation messages**: Show rich messages using HTML for onboarding, compliance, or guidance
- **Contact information**: Display relevant IT or business support details
- **Device details**: Surface technical and diagnostic info from the device itself
- **Custom layouts**: Build fully bespoke experiences with stack-based layouts, app cards, banners, section titles, and more
