**Features & improvements**

- Improved reliability of the certificate worker, and merged CA/P12 functions into one to reduce duplicate code.

Note on certs: only install, not select, is implemented. If your EMM doesn't support private key rules please get in touch, but users will still be able to self-select certificates to use in apps.
