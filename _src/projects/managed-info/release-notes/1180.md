    title: Release 1.1.8.0
---

This is a considerable release touching a lot of areas of the application. Furthermore, this release **removes most licence requirements**. See [this announcement](/blog/2026/01/managed-info-hub-licence-free) for details.

**Features & improvements**

- Licensing has been mostly removed.
- Added a managed configuration-controlled app drawer for launcher mode  
  - Supports unrestricted app visibility or allowlisted packages only  
  - Allows administrators to expose a controlled app drawer alongside kiosk or card-based layouts
- Improved launcher reliability using a dual activity alias setup for safer launcher switching  
- Significant improvements to app list handling, caching, and refresh behaviour  
- Better handling of app install, update, and removal events  
- Launcher UI refinements, including spacing, icon sizing limits, and colour consistency  
- Improved background and dispatcher usage to reduce UI blocking and race conditions  
- Refactored app escape sheet and installed package logic for correctness and maintainability  
- Reduced unnecessary managed configuration updates by only reacting to meaningful changes  
- Improved WorkManager initialisation sequencing and retry behaviour  
- General code clean-up, refactors, and stability improvements across the app  

**Fixes**

- Fixed crashes occurring during or immediately after device boot  
- Improved handling of revoked permissions to prevent stalled or inconsistent behaviour  
- Notification icon fixes and improved wallpaper-related notifications  
- Fixed issues with component state management and settings toggles  
- Resolved inconsistencies in managed configuration hydration and update handling  

**Known issues**

- On first launch after updating, the app may briefly close while launcher components are reconfigured. Re-launching the app resolves this and is only required once.
- If you have previously configured settings in the app managed config which were previously licensed, and you have no license, **they will now apply**.
