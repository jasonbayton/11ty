**Features & improvements**

- Added support for app usage data in order to report on data usage (network - Wi-Fi, cellular) on a daily/weekly/monthly basis
- Added Wi-Fi details to the device info cards, so with permissions, all current network details are now present in the UI
- Added a raw dump of deviceinfo for debugging
- **Device identifiers (IMEI, serial, etc) no longer require a licence to display.. just the correct EMM policy.**
- Moved the play integrity functionality to a repo for sharing around the app
- Added a dedicated location foreground service for more reliable location reporting

**Fixes**

- I typically avoid doing this as it's vague, but this release genuinely has miscellaneous fixes mostly to UI, a little to logic.

**Known issues**

- Currently observing behaviour where the CA certificate is reinstalled on a reboot. There's no explicit logic for this use case, so this is still under investigation
