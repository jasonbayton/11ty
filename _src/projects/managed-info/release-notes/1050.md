**Features & improvements**

MANAGED INFO has had a complete refactor of the managed configuration implementation, and an overhaul of memory management. For lower-powered devices and those with complex card layouts, the application should feel more responsive. This is additionally assisted with the introduction of a loader.

In addition, MANAGED INFO will now fetch a PING UUID from any already-installed BAYTON application, or generate a new one if none exist.

Additional features and improvements:

- Admin override implemented for kiosk/launcher modes, allowing temporary access to all applications.
- Device identifier retrieval improved with DataStore caching.
- Loader implemented and animation updated for heavy card layouts.
- New theme override and custom text-on-background colour parameters added.
- UUID display and sharing via content provider added to settings UI.
- Licence validation worker refactored with timeout and periodic improvements.
- Activation record worker updated to use shared UUID logic.
- New interface for PING endpoints.
- Default configuration settings updated.
- Configuration mapping logic refactored and offloaded unmanaged defaults to classes.
- Provider declaration and permission for UUID sharing added to manifest.
- Main activity refactored for improved reliability and cooldown handling.
- Licence state and API call logic improved for reactivity and reliability.
- Increased reliability for order sending and contact info fallback.

**Fixes**

- Licence state initialization and API call refactoring.
- Minor documentation and code style updates.
- Fix imports.
- Fix top nav layout.
- Fixed licence state always initializing to false.
- Fixed missing cards on unmanaged devices.
- Fixed BOM version mismatch.
- Fixed queries in API call.
- App view model refactored to avoid polling for empty or invalid packages.
