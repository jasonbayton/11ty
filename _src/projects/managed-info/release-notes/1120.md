**Features & improvements**

- Added support for video cards (Youtube). This is in <span class="label label-green">beta</span>. If you choose to test this, please provide feedback!
- Added SVG support for images
- Added an Android version card in Device Trust
- Added support for Play Integrity in Device Trust, as well as a (hidden) configuration to block enrolment when using MANAGED INFO as a companion app and launching SetupActions.
- Reduced critical apps to a fixed list. When using the companion app role, the system application list expands to everything installed on the device. This is no good right now.
- Turned off Device Trust Device Info card for now
- Added support for rectification - where the Device Trust cards can tap to the appropriate settings screen to rectify an issue. Only the backend is done currently.

**Fixes**

- Cleaned up old/redundant code
- Adjusted some strings to better match the rest of the app
- Attempt (again) to remove the garbage disposal error conditions
