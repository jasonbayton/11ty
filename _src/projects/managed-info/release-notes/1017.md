**Features & improvements**

- Full kiosk implementation
  - Custom background image
    - Full support for JPG, PNG, Bitmap. 
    - Images are scaled, cropped, and centred. 
    - When testing backgrounds, aim for a size that fits all resolutions, with a working centre point that will not obscure apps or text.
  - Universal card scaling transparency 
    - Sets the transparency of cards from 0 through 10, allowing customisable card backgrounds depending on the background in use
  - App grid card toggleable transparency 
    - Allows a toggle between a card-based app grid, or more of a traditional launcher with icons directly on the background
  - Added theme colour customisation
    - Text colour
    - Card colour
    - Background colour
    - More granularity can be added based on demand
  - Added a label background for apps in grid

- Only trigger updates to managed config when it differs to what's cached
- Deprecated `space evenly` in app cards as it's no longer needed
- Refactored the app grid card to use LazyVerticalGrid, Horizontal grids still use FlowRow (for now?)
