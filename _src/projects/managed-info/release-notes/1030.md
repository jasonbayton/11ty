**Features & improvements**

- Adjusted colour of device information card bottom sheet
- Add title size configuration
- Add launcher toggle 
  - It's now possible to toggle on launcher mode, and use `persistent preferred activities` within an EMM to set MANAGED INFO as the device launcher/home screen
 
**Fixes**

- Fix imports
- Fix licensing for device information card

**Known issues**

- MANAGED INFO will close when the launcher toggle is set, this is a limitation of Android and cannot be avoided. Simply reopen the app under the new app name **INFO Launcher**.
