**Features & improvements**

N/A

**Fixes**

- Fixed a slightly overexcited location service sending 2x+ location pings to the configured server.
- Removed runblocking where it wasn't needed

**Known issues**

- Currently observing behaviour where the CA certificate is reinstalled on a reboot. There's no explicit logic for this use case, so this is still under investigation
