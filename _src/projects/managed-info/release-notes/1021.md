**Features & improvements**

- Added a new configuration to hide the missing packages error shown in the app grid, as sometimes said apps simply aren't available on all devices, especially things like dialler between a phone and tablet. Now it can be hidden, and only valid apps will show up in the grid.
 
**Fixes**

- I broke the device info logic when I added the new button, this fixes that.
- Fixed an unfiltered error when a package isn't found
- Brought back logic to allow app gaps when the packages are defined in CSV with `..example, ,com..` in the app grid card
