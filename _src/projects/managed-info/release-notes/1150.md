    title: Release 1.1.5.0
---

Note: 1.1.4.0 includes all the below _except_ the managed config system refactor, allowing me to roll back to 1.1.4.0 should 1.1.5.0 become unstable from the MC changes.

**Features & improvements**

- Refactored managed config system into a singleton to improve stability and eliminate multiple-instance race conditions.
- Moved restriction receiver handling into managed config system to ensure lifecycle-independent reception of configuration updates.
- Reworked initial configuration so ViewModels and workers see managed configuration immediately on first use.
- Introduced device info repository, adding structured collection of device information including Wi‑Fi details, SoC fallback parsing, and more. This replaces the work a single ViewModel was doing, allowing it to be reused across the app.
- Added true device uptime using `elapsedRealtime()`, and a new “time in use” metric using `uptimeMillis()`.
- Improved reliability of the certificate worker, merging CA and P12 handling paths and implementing drift protection.
- Added a metadata worker for remote metadata sync to EMM-configured endpoints
- Improved Location worker behaviour during boot and removed redundant network constraints to avoid callback exhaustion.
- Added support for showing settings in the Managed Device Dashboard when companion settings are enabled.
- Added Wi‑Fi information to DeviceInfo (SSID, BSSID, security, frequencies, channel width, link speeds) with graceful fallback when permissions are missing. This only shows in the metadata export presently.
- Improved internal logging across the app.
- General clean‑up of old or redundant code.

**Fixes**

- Fixed regression preventing fallback card from showing when no stacks were configured.
- Corrected runBlocking usages inside suspend contexts.
- Fixed inaccurate device uptime reporting by switching from `uptimeMillis()` to `elapsedRealtime()`.
- Corrected SOC_MANUFACTURER and SOC_MODEL handling by treating them as nullable and falling back to /proc/cpuinfo.
