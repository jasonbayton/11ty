**Features & improvements**

- Hardened wallpaper worker for improved reliability
- Hardened package install worker for improved reliability 
- Introduced support for certificate installation (delegated scope required)

Note on certs: only install, not select, is implemented. If your EMM doesn't support private key rules please get in touch, but users will still be able to self-select certificates to use in apps.
