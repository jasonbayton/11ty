**Features & improvements**

N/A
 
**Fixes**

- Pushed a fix for serialise. This was used to parse JSON prior to updating the backend.

**Known issues**

- When package changes are detected, the whole UI will redraw. This is not noticeable on high-spec devices but may be seen by low/mid-range devices. A fix is under investigation
- When approving permissions, a restart of the app is required. Investigation is underway.
