## Introduction

Welcome to BAYTON projects. This privacy policy explains how I collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use or engage with my projects. By using these projects, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Company information

**Contact name**: JASON BAYTON  
**Contact email**: [project-support@bayton.org](mailto:project-support@bayton.org)

## Application details

**Application name(s)**: PACKAGE SEARCH, MANAGED SETTINGS, MANAGED INFO, MANAGED ARCHIVER, QR CODE  
**Purpose**: Application information and package name extraction, settings management, information management, data backup, device provisioning.

## Definitions

- **Personal data**: Any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual.
- **Processing**: Any operation performed on personal data, such as collection, use, storage, or disclosure.
- **Data subject**: An individual whose personal data is being processed.

## Data collection

### Types of data collected

- **Basic device details**: Non-identifiable information including Android device make, model, OS version, the application in use, the country a device resides in, and the licence key used may be collected.
- **Application information**: Upon opt-in of [application version tracking](/projects/package-search/support/enable-package-sync) in PACKAGE SEARCH: application names, package names, and versions installed.
- **Feature use**: Analytics and configuration data of the application(s) in use.
- **Messages sent/received**: Upon use of the MANAGED ARCHIVER project, and when choosing to use the default PING infrastructure for message backup.
- **Precise location**: MANAGED INFO 1.0.9.0 introduces EMM companion functionality, expanding on package (APK) installation and setup actions in 1.0.8.x. From 1.0.9.0 an administrator can request periodic location from MANAGED INFO when used as the EMM companion app. All location data is sent to the organisation of the Android Enterprise-managed device. No location data is uploaded or stored to PING or any other BAYTON infrastructure.

### Collection methods

- **Basic device details**: Collected on application/project engagement and sent to the BAYTON application activation (PING) server.
- **Application information**: Upon opt-in of [application version tracking](/projects/package-search/support/enable-package-sync) in PACKAGE SEARCH, the user-installed applications of the device in-use will be sent to the PING service for the purpose of application version monitoring with Google Play.
- **Feature use**: Collected when devices check in with PING infrastructure
- **Messages sent/received**: Direct upload when the application is configured to do so
- **Precise location**: Direct upload to organisation-configured endpoint

### Cookies and tracking technologies

I do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies in-app.

## Data usage

### Purposes of data usage

- Aggregated application use
- Troubleshooting
- Enhanced functionality
- To perform services

### Automated decision-making

- No automated decision-making or profiling is conducted with the collected data.

## Legal bases for processing

- **Legitimate interests**: Processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of BAYTON, such as improving my services, provided these interests are not overridden by the user's rights and interests.

## Data sharing

- **Third parties**: I do not actively share user data with any specific third parties, however aggregated usage data is available on the respective project pages showing install base and hardware variance as graphs.
- **International Transfers**: No international data transfers are conducted.

## Data retention

- **Anonymised device information**: Retained for 90 days.
- **Business and contact information**: Not retained.
- **Messaging data**: Defined by contractual SLA
- **Location data**: Not retained, not uploaded to BAYTON infrastructure

## Data removal

The majority of BAYTON projects data is non-identifiable, and used for analytics & support, the following exceptions apply:

- MANAGED ARCHIVER may be configured to back up messaging data to PING servers if an organisation chooses to avoid setting up their own infrastructure.
- Managed configuration data (e.g. licensed organisation ID) applied across all projects is used for licensing & support, which may identify an organisation.

Should you wish to remove data associated with your use of BAYTON project applications, please:

1. Make a copy of the PING UUID in application settings (typically by tapping the menu icon and scrolling to the bottom of the Settings page)
2. Submit your request to [project-support@bayton.org](mailto:project-support@bayton.org) with the UUID of your device.
3. Data will be expunged within 24 hours of acknowledgement

**Note**: If data is known to be associated with the services provided to organisations, commercially or voluntarily, any requests from individuals may be redirected to organisation IT representatives for approval. This will delay deletion.
