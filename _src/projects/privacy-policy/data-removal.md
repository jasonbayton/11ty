    title: BAYTON projects data removal
---

The majority of BAYTON projects data is non-identifiable, and used for analytics & support, the following exceptions apply:

- MANAGED ARCHIVER may be configured to back up messaging data to PING servers if an organisation chooses to avoid setting up their own infrastructure.
- Managed configuration data (e.g licensed organisation ID) applied across all projects is used for licensing & support, which may identify an organisation.
- MANAGED INFO may be configured to store device location reports in PING servers if an organisation chooses to avoid setting up their own infrastructure.

Should you wish to expunge data associated with your use of BAYTON project applications, please:

1. Make a copy of the PING UUID in application settings (typically by tapping the menu icon and scrolling to the bottom of the Settings page)
2. Submit your request to [project-support@bayton.org](mailto:project-support@bayton.org) with the UUID of your device.
3. Data will be expunged within 24 hours of acknowledgement

Note: If data is known to be associated with the services provided to organisations, commercially or voluntarily, any requests from individuals may be redirected to organisation IT representitives for approval. This will delay deletion.
