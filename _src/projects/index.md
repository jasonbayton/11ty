## MANAGED SETTINGS

MANAGED SETTINGS offers organisations a means of providing a limited device Settings experience, preventing over-exposing device settings that should not be visible or interactive for managed device end users.

Perfect for Kiosk deployment scenarios, or simply limiting the settings available to fully managed devices.

## MANAGED INFO & Kiosk

MANAGED INFO & Kiosk is a flexible kiosk launcher, support tool, and device companion for Android Enterprise fleets.

It adapts to whatever role your fleet needs - from a full home-screen replacement with infinitely-customisable layouts that anchors kiosk deployments, to a lightweight device overview/support tool that keeps essential information and contact details within easy reach. 

In addition, MANAGED INFO & Kiosk builds in deep, config-driven MDM companion integration, such as APK deployment capabilities, location tracking services, Device Trust from Android Enterprise, and more.. it surfaces tailored support, status, and actions right where administrators and users expect them.
