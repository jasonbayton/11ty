### OEM or reseller?

I welcome additional devices for testing! If you’re an **OEM** or **reseller** of Android devices, you can join **Sony**, **Nokia**, **Huawei**, **Lenovo** and others in lending me anything from Android 6.0.1 or later to independently test. This is a free service, devices can be returned within a week or so. Use my [contact](/contact/) page to get in touch or [email me directly](mailto:jason@bayton.org).

For more information on what’s involved in testing, please head to: [Android Enterprise independent validation process and information](/android/android-enterprise-device-support/validation-process-and-information/).

Introduced in June 2019, advanced testing follows the [process highlighted here](/android/android-enterprise-device-support/validation-process-and-information/), with each individual restriction/function documented and verified irrespective of outcome across at least two EMMs.

A report containing 700+ touch points is provided to the OEM on completion along with any recommendations.
