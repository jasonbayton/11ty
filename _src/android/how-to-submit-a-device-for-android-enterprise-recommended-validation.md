If you’re an OEM looking for a way to submit your device for Android Enterprise Recommended validation, the process is simple:

Nominate the device
-------------------

From 2020 the nomination process has moved from a Google Form, to the Android Enterprise Partner community.

To join the community:

1. Register for an account in the [Android Enterprise Partner Portal](https://www.androidenterprise.dev/s)
2. Within the portal, select COMMUNITIES -&gt; APPLY FOR COMMUNITIES from the menu
3. Fill out the application form and you’ll be sent a welcome email once the application is processed

Ensure the device meets requirements
------------------------------------

Google will give the OEM access to the AER requirements site, which cover both the hardware software requirements and recommendations they will be validating.

If the device isn’t currently passing the CTS and aligning to the CDD for example, there’s little point in continuing until this is the case (remember these are updated annually, so the OEM must ensure devices remain compliant).

Ship it
-------

Once ready for validation, the OEM may ship the device(s) to a Google office (named by Google). Google will validate the device and the OEM will be informed whether the device validated or not.

If the device(s) did not pass validation, the OEM will be informed of why and given the opportunity to resubmit once issues are resolved.
