There is no path to convert a MADA device (GMS/Play Protect certified) to EDLA. 

While Google offered a grace period during the introduction of the EDLA licence, this has long since closed. To convert a MADA device to EDLA, it must undergo new EDLA certification, and both SKUs (if >1000 are in market) must be supported for the licence period.
