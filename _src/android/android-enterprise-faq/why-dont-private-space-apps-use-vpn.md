The Private Space is a separated, isolated profile on the Android device, similar to the work profile. If a VPN configuration is created on one profile (be that personal/parent, work, or Private Space), it won't apply for the applications running in another profile. To have Private Space apps running in a VPN, configure a VPN application within the Private Space.
