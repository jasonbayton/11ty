No. 

Iâ€™d recommend taking a look at [Hypergate](https://hypergate.com).

There is however a project which was initiated (but not wholly supported) by Google to bring Kerberos support to Android through an application. Take a look at the respective [GitHub repo](https://github.com/google/android-kerberos-authenticator) to learn more.
