Android One and Android Enterprise Recommended are two different programmes offering a bit of overlap in security and consistency.

Android Enterprise Recommended ensures devices validated meet the minimum requirements and recommendations of a consistent UX for management, 90 day security updates for 3 years and at least one letter upgrade (O to P, P to Q.. ). OEMs maintain their value-adds, bundled apps, custom UIs and more.

Android One takes this a step further; any device in the Android One programme will use a system image developed with Google. Like the Nexus days of old, the UI is vanilla Android and the Android One team have to approve any additional applications bundled with the device.

Updates must be released every 30 days and the devices must support two letter upgrades (O to Q, P to R, etc).

When combined with AER, Android One offers additional benefits validated to work in the enterprise. Itâ€™s a great combination.
