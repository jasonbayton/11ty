Application management within the Private Space is limited to only company-owned work profile devices. Personally owned devices - or BYOD - cannot manage the Personal Space in any way. Fully managed devices do not support Private Space.

For company-owned work profile devices, the personal usage policies of **personal Play Store mode** and **personal applications** apply both to the parent (personal) profile, _and_ the Private Space. 

If your organisation already leverages policies to allow or block applications in the parent profile on a COPE device, these will carry over automatically to the Personal Space.

**Note**: It is not possible to set different personal Play Store modes, or configure separate allow/blocklist policies between the parent profile and the Personal Space.
