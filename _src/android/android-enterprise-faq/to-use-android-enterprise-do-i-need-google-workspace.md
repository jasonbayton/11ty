No. 

Unless you are already a Google Workspace customer, you can use your EMM console to register a new Android Enterprise organisation with any existing Google (managed or unmanaged) account, or soon, a Microsoft 365 account, and your EMM will create unique and generic managed Google Play service accounts on each Android device that allow you to sign in to the Google Play Store and receive configs & policies. These accounts are silently added to the device. You do not need to configure your domain, create users, or manage the authentication to services like Active Directory.
