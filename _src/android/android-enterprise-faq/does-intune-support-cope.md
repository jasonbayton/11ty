Yes.

As of 2020, Intune supports work profiles on fully managed devices from Android 8.0. This is because Google’s [Android Management API introduced support](/2020/07/googles-android-management-api-will-soon-support-cope/) for the deployment scenario (albeit silently, intentionally avoiding stating as such in it’s wider Android 11 COPE announcement).
