No. 

Applications and data stored within the Private Space are **not** visible to enterprise administrators, this follows the existing premise set with the parent profile in a work profile (company/personally-owned) deployment. If this is an organisational concern, application policies [can be set](/android/android-enterprise-faq/manage-apps-in-private-space) for company-owned work profile deployments.
