I’ve encountered several examples of things not working quite right with AER devices, particularly when diving into the granularity of a specific function with a specific EMM.

The first point of contact for any device based issue would be the EMM vendor. While it may not be an issue which can be replicated on a different model or OEM, the EMM vendor will still investigate it, particularly if it can be replicated on one or more devices of the same model.

Before contacting the EMM, the organisation should ensure the issue can be replicated on more than one device. If so, attempt to collect logs from the EMM, the device (a bug report, though be aware this will collect personal account information also) and steps to replicate it along with all of the normal details – make, model, Android version, build number, etc. A video is always appreciated though do add the steps on paper also.

If the EMM can replicate it but cannot resolve it, they will have OEM contacts to reach out to to progress it. If necessary, Google will be involved once all other avenues are exhausted, or it’s determined to be a platform issue.

I do a fair amount of device testing, so if you do come across something and your EMM is not providing the support needed, feel free to [reach out](/contact) and I’ll be happy to help.
