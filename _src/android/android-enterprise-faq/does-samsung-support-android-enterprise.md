Yes. 

Since Android 5.x (Lollipop), like all other OEMs, it has been possible to deploy for free a work profile or provision a fully managed device using Samsung devices and a preferred EMM solution. From Android 8.0 and Knox 3.0, Samsung further integrated AE by having the Knox Workspace container use the Android Enterprise Profile Owner APIs to inflate the Workspace, and as of late 2020 also [began supporting zero-touch](/2020/11/google-announce-big-changes-to-zero-touch/) in addition to their existing KME service. Customers can optionally select to activate a Knox Platform for Enterprise licence to enable premium features on the device, including all of the APIs from the previously separate Knox Standard, Knox Custom and Knox Premium SDKs.
