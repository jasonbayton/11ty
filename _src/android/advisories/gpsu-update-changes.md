As of late March 2024, Google Play System Updates, or Mainline updates as they're also known, are no longer managed by AMAPI system update policies. 

With system update policies set (automatic, window, postpone, freeze), GPSUs will revert to their unmanaged behaviour. 

Check the [techdoc](/android/gpsu-system-update/) for more info.
