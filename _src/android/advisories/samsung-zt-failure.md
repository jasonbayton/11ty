Following earlier reports of zero-touch enrolment failing for Samsung devices running OneUI 6/Android 14, Samsung last week updated their [KB](https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-platform-for-enterprise/kbas/kba-1120-unable-to-enroll-device-with-zero-touch-enrollment/) with details of a temporary resolution, with a permanent fix to come through OTA at a later date.

> As of January 22nd, 2024, Google has implemented a server-side update to temporarily resolve this issue. The affected devices can now be enrolled through zero-touch enrollment.
>
> Samsung is preparing a One UI 6.1 firmware update that includes the updated Google Play Service (`GmsCore`) app to permanently fix this issue. The One UI 6.1 update will be available as a software update to the affected devices.
