## 1. Tech specs

Android 9   
6.2 inch HD display   
Snapdragon 632  
4GB RAM  
64GB Storage  
12.2/8MP Cameras  

## 2. Android Enterprise support

- Work profile (BYOD) ⚠️
- Fully managed (COBO) ⚠️
- Fully managed with work profile (COPE) ⚠️
- Dedicated (COSU) ⚠️

## 3. In-depth testing report


**How to read this report**. This device has been tested against the public [validation process](/android/android-enterprise-device-support/validation-process-and-information/), in which all provisioning methods and deployment scenarios have been tested across at least two EMM platforms.

Where a feature works with one EMM, but does not with another (consider **Enforce max failed attempts** in the report below) this is considered a pass (green) as it’s likely an EMM issue. Where it does not work, partly or fully, across two or more EMMs this will be flagged as a warn (yellow), or a fail (red).

Some features aren’t supported or set up across EMMs, or don’t work with the device (consider **KME** below), where this is the case the feature will be marked as untested (purple).

## 4. Notes from the above report

### 4.1. Device issues

#### 4.1.1. Very old security update applied

On test the device ran the December ’18 security update, with no additional updates available. This would be considered a breach of Android Enterprise Recommended requirements.

#### 4.1.2. Provisioning / Wizard interjections

A Motorola privacy/T&C screen pops up at the end of provisioning, interrupting the flow across all provisioning methods

#### 4.1.3. Work profile / Disallow work widgets

Despite being set across EMMs, Disallow work widgets on the personal home screen is not enforced, allowing work widgets to be freely placed.

**This is a device issue** (or an API has changed in Pie).

#### 4.1.4. Fully managed / Keep screen on when plugged in

Despite the single setting and multiple settings applied in MobileIron and VMware respectively, when plugged into multiple power sources the screen ultimately turned off. The exception is AMAPI, however the screen still dims, making it less than useful.

As passcode policies were applied including mandated timeout, these could have clashed however this hasn’t been the case with other devices.

This can be replicated. **This may be a device issue.**

#### 4.1.5. Fully managed / FRP enforced in COPE following an unauthorised reset

**Not unique to the Moto**, at the moment when deployed as a COPE device (fully managed device with work profile) and a personal account is added to the parent profile, should the device be reset in an unauthorised manner, for example:

- Incorrect passcode entered too many times
- Wipe command from some EMMs

The device will lock to the personal Google account residing in the parent profile. This is irrespective of any FRP bypass in place, though it hasn’t been tested as to whether FRP whitelist would override this behaviour.

Replicated across two EMMs. **This is a device issue**, but appears to be more OS-level as it affects other devices also.

#### 4.1.6. Fully managed / System update control

Normally when system update control is enforced it is not possible to enter system update settings, with a prompt stating updates are managed. The Motorola permits access and gives no indication updates are managed.

### 4.2. Other noted warns/fails

The following weren’t replicated issues, but were flagged as the device didn’t behave as expected when tested. They are described below to offer context for why a warn or fail was registered during testing.

#### 4.2.1 Device Passcode / Enforce max attempts

Under COPE in VMware, max failed attempts incorrectly enforces against the work profile rather than the device in the device passcode policy. As such, once a maximum has been reached, VMware removes the work profile instead of resetting the device, leaving it in a partially broken state.

**This is a VMware issue.**

#### 4.2.2. Work profile / Disallow location

Despite being set, the work profile location can be toggled on &amp; off by the user at will.

#### 4.2.3. Work profile / Cross-profile sharing

The two settings:

- Disallow work apps to access documents from personal apps
- Disallow personal apps to share documents with work apps

In MobileIron and AMAPI there are no explicit options to prevent this and is therefore on by default.

In VMware the options are present, and neither of the above mentioned API restrictions are enforced.

#### 4.2.4. Work profile / Work challenge

VMware supports work challenge, however misses options to prevent some advanced restrictions compared to the device passcode policy. Marked as a warning.

#### 4.2.5. Dedicated / Kiosk

There are numerous issues with the MobileIron kiosk, these are not limited to the Moto G7 Power. The affected policies:

- Kiosk cannot be escaped
- No access to settings other than those explicitly permitted
- Kiosk auto-launches

Despite the relevant configurations in place, it is effortless to escape the MobileIron kiosk if any access to settings has been granted. For example should Wi-Fi settings be available:

- Tap kiosk settings
- Tap Wi-Fi
- In the systems settings screen, tap the back arrow or hamburger menu
- Full settings access is granted

**This is a MobileIron issue**, and it affects many devices including recent Nokia and Sony examples.

## 5. Recommendation

There are certainly some features organisations may want that aren’t properly supported as shown in the report above, though these are more likely to be limited to the EMM in use.

Generally the device supports Android Enterprise pretty well, so I’d have no issue recommending it on that basis, however the very outdated security update applied to my EU test unit raises concerns over Moto’s commitment towards security, **especially being an Android Enterprise Recommended device**.

For that reason I would not recommend the device until I see Moto prioritising timely security updates going forward.
