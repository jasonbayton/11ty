If your EMM doesn't offer customisation for your generated QR codes, you can use the below form to generate your own. This configurator is intended for use with all known EMMs; those that use any custom DPC.

**No information is stored**. If you refresh the page, everything will be reset. This is intentional as I have no interest in holding on to your JSON information, Wi-Fi details, or enrolment tokens. That said, as with all third-party applications you use this at your own risk. Check with your boss before you generate tokens if you feel you need to.

**What you need**:

- Your EMM-provided DPC information
- Your DPC extras
- Your Wi-Fi configuration details (if desired)

When you click Generate QR, all submitted information is processed locally, and the returned image is embedded ephemerally in this page. Right click & save to keep it, edit the submitted text and click generate again to renew it, or refresh the page to clear it.

If the image doesn't load, [raise an issue](https://github.com/jasonbayton/11ty/issues/new/choose) and I'll take a look.
