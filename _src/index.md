Iâ€™ve dedicated over a decade to Android, more than half of that catered towards enterprise building, deploying, and supporting hundreds of thousands of managed Android devices as an ecosystem product leader and Certified Android Enterprise Expert. Organisations trust me for my in-depth product & solution knowledge, broad ecosystem experience across OEMs, EMMs, solution providers, and my open & transparent approach to education and training.

 Get in touch with me to discuss how I can make modern management simpler, enhance corporate security, and boost productivity for you and your organisation, partners, and/or customers.
