If you have an existing JSON payload, be that from an EMM platform or one you've written from scratch, it can be imported into the below form via this input.

JSON formatting isn't validated, in fact there is nothing implemented currently to alert to any issues with the config, it will try to blindly import the various keys and values, and things will fail if it cannot.

Please feel free to test and [provide feedback](/contact)!
