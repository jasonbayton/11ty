The Android Enterprise Enrolment Token is a unique identifier that is used to enrol Android devices into an organisation's AMAPI-powered EMM. This token is generated by the EMM provider and is used during the provisioning process to establish a relationship between the device and the EMM server. This then allows the EMM provider to manage and configure device settings, install applications, and enforce security policies on behalf of the organisation.

The enrolment token should be closely guarded as it grants access to the organisation's EMM platform and may grant access to sensitive corporate resources. If the token is compromised, it should be revoked immediately and a new one generated.
