On most days of the week you'll find me contributing to one of these main communities:

1. The Android Enterprise Customer Community
2. The Mobile Pros expert community (co-founder)
3. BAYTON Discord
4. LinkedIn

I pop up occasionally in other places, but you'll always find me in the above, where I contribute several hours a week towards partner, peer, and customer questions & issues, publish new and interesting news and/or viewpoints on topics in the ecosystem, and help out wherever else I can.
