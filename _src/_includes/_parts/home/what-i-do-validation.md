I work with EMMs and OEMs across the ecosystem to review, validate, and improve their Android Enterprise products and services. On any given month I receive access to a new EMM platform to review, or an Android device (consumer, rugged, dedicated, bespoke) to put through its paces. 

Described as Android Enterprise Recommended testing on steroids, my product validations have been used in sales decks the world over to demonstrate a partner's ability to execute on Android across all major EMMs, OEMs, or other vendor solutions.

Are you looking for help with your Android Enterprise solution?
