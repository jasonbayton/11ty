### Device administrator deprecation
Device admin deprecation is now official with Android 10! Unsure what this means? Take a look at this [infographic](/docs/enterprise-mobility/android/infobyte-did-you-know-device-admin-deprecation/), this [article](/2017/12/google-is-deprecating-device-admin-in-favour-of-android-enterprise/) and this [article](/2019/03/android-enterprise-in-q-features-and-clarity-on-da-deprecation/#clarity-on-da-deprecation-in-q). All EMMs must now be targeting API 29, which means all deprecated DA APIs for Android 10 devices are enforced.
