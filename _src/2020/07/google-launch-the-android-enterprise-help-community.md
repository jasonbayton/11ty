Today Google [announced](https://blog.google/products/android-enterprise/help-community/) the public availability of the [Android Enterprise Help Community](https://support.google.com/work/android/community?hl=en), a community resource tied to the [Android Enterprise Help Center](https://support.google.com/work/android/?hl=en#topic=6151012).

Driven primarily by community experts (Google Product Experts), the Help Community offers the wider ecosystem of partners and customers a place to discuss all things Android Enterprise, whether EMM issues, device questions, zero-touch queries, deployment or in-life support concerns, best practices, tips or really anything else. As long as it’s AE, it’s fair game.

The community has been up and running for a little bit, and a few customers have stumbled upon it no doubt while perusing the Help Center articles, which has given GPEs like myself a bit of time to become familiar with the platform and a taste of the types of questions to come.

[They](https://support.google.com/s/community/forum/32063981/search/query%3Dforum%253A32063981/thread/58983797). [Are](https://support.google.com/s/community/forum/32063981/search/query%3Dforum%253A32063981/thread/57551030). [Varied](https://support.google.com/s/community/forum/32063981/search/query%3Dforum%253A32063981/thread/57397475).

This is a great initiative by Google to get the experts out of the private Android Enterprise Google-run communities and into the public domain, and from now on you’ll find me spending time a fair bit of time there!
