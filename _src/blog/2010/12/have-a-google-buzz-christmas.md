T’was the night before Christmas and all through the house,  
Not a creature was stirring, unless you count my mouse!

You see the internet was alive and incredibly active,  
Buzz, Facebook, Twitter, it was all so attractive!

I said “Hey” to my friends on Facebook, broadcast “Merry Christmas” on Twitter,  
But it was Google Buzz that got me all in a jitter.

So many people I would consider my friends,  
Were online and talking, conversation that never ends.

“Merry Christmas” I said, @ing all I knew,  
But unlike other social networks, replies were not few!

We would then discuss Christmas, our plans for new year  
A Buzz that was public, so all could bring cheer.

An atmosphere so friendly, with problems so few,  
This was my social network of choice, I simply knew.

Conversation so full, so many different topics,  
People from Europe, America, the tropics!

Sharing pictures, and videos and music and more,  
What else could a Buzzer really ask for?

Everyone’s welcome to Buzzes I make,  
But don’t stay online all day, it’s Christmas for goodness sake!

And a special thank you to the Google Buzz Team  
For making a social network of which one could only dream!

Enjoy Christmas one and all, my best to your family and you,  
And if we don’t talk again this year, Happy New Year, too.

Merry Christmas!  
Jason 🙂
