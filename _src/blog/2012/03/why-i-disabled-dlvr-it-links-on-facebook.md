Should you have read any of my previous posts regarding dlvr.it ([link](/2011/08/push-your-google-posts-to-twitter-and-facebook/ "Push your Google+ posts to Twitter and Facebook"), [link](/2011/05/pushing-buzz-to-twitter-with-dlvr-it/ "Pushing Buzz to Twitter with dlvr.it"), [link](/2011/05/managing-your-social-outreach-with-dlvr-it/ "Managing your social outreach with dlvr.it")) you’ll know I not only enjoy using their service – allowing me to share my posts and articles with multiple social networks – but I basically fully rely on it.

There has, however, always been an issue with cross-posting to Facebook.

Within the dlvr.it options for cross-posting messages to Facebook you have the option to post as a status update, a note or a link. As I want to make it appear as though I am actively using the network, I’ve always opted for the status update with as much content as it’ll allow. The difference between posts sent to Facebook and, say, Twitter is the *link placement*.

On Twitter, the link is posted *after* the original content to prompt you to continue reading:

![Link at the end](https://r2_worker.bayton.workers.dev/uploads/2012/03/Capture1.png "Twitter")

On Facebook, the first thing you see is the link, this immediately puts you off reading the content that follows:

![Facebook links at the beginning](https://r2_worker.bayton.workers.dev/uploads/2012/03/Capture2.png "Facebook fail")

When I say “puts you off reading”, I mean it. After toying with the idea of turning the links off all together, I decided that it was ultimately necessary in order to regain the engagement I was always used to getting when I was active on Facebook and not pushing my posts from Google+.

The proof was in the pudding as highlighted here:

![No link = engagement](https://r2_worker.bayton.workers.dev/uploads/2012/03/Capture3.png "Facebook Win")

Naturally, this test was not very scientific at all, but since turning off the links the comments and likes have been rolling in in a manner that reminded me of the days when I *only* used Facebook, the days when people read what I posted and didn’t overlook it due to a ghastly (albeit custom) link stuck right at the beginning of the content.

When I cornered dlvr.it over this “issue”, they responded:

![Dlvr.it say it's normal](https://r2_worker.bayton.workers.dev/uploads/2012/03/Capture4.png "Dlvr.it response")

Personally? I don’t see why that matters. If someone is reading your post, they will click “read more’ to finish it off anyway. By stuffing the link in a reader’s face immediately I believe more harm is being done than not having the link on display until “read more” is clicked, if a post is infact long enough to require that.

So for now, links are disabled on my Google+ &gt; Facebook route, and will remain that way until dlvr.it fix it. Even if that does cause the odd comment of confusion on occasion when a post cuts off prematurely.

Have you noticed a drop in engagement on Facebook since using dlvr.it with the links activated? Perhaps you should give this a go, also.

Cheers,  
Jason
